# MyReads Project
 This project can be used to search for book titles and store them on different shelves depending on what you are currently reading, what you have read and what you would like to read.Data is persisted by the udacity backend server.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* clone this repository 
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Technology
* Reactjs
* JSX
* AJAX
* JavaScript(ECMAScript) 6
* React-router

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
